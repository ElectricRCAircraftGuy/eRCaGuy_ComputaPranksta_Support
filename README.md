# eRCaGuy_ComputaPranksta_Support
Public support for my "Computa Pranksta" mouse jiggler device I [sell on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2ReBSuN) and elsewhere.

This device is a mouse jiggler. It keeps your computer awake. It can also be used to have some fun with your friends (please don't take it too far--it's meant to be used in good, friendly gest--not for any type of malicious purposes).

# How to program/reconfigure it

<a id="1-in-as-few-words-as-possible"></a>
## 1. In as few words as possible

1. Plug it into a Windows computer, and give it a minute to start working. It should begin to drag your mouse cursor to the lower left corner of the screen, and slowly type random characters periodically. 
1. Once you see it working, open up a text editor (Notepad is recommended) and press `Scroll Lock` 5 times to enter programming mode. Refer to the bottom-right of the **"Quick Reference Sheet"** just below. It will type out some text into Notepad to indicate it is entering programming mode. 
1. Now, in programming mode, you can cycle through the various modes using a series of `Scroll Lock` and `Caps Lock` key presses. Refer to the bottom-right of the **"Quick Reference Sheet"** just below for details. 
1. When done choosing the modes you like, press `Scroll Lock` 5 times again to save and exit. Your new modes will now be in effect. 
    1. _So long as you pressed `Scroll Lock` 5 times and saw it type out the text indicating it was saving and exiting programming mode_, you can now unplug the device and plug it back in, even moving it to a different computer if you like, and its settings will still be saved, since they are saved _internally on-board the device itself_, NOT on your computer. (For details for fellow nerds, [see here](https://github.com/ElectricRCAircraftGuy/eRCaGuy_ComputaPranksta_Support/issues/1).)
1. If you have further questions you can reach out to me via my business email on the product label or found under the ["Contact Me" tab at the top of my website here](https://www.electricrcaircraftguy.com/2017/04/computa-pranksta-user-manual.html), where the user manual is stored.
1. For a detailed video demonstration of this process, see the YouTube videos in the ["Main Links"](#main-links) section just above.

# Credits and Base Technologies 

As is the case with most projects anyone does, I am standing on the shoulds of giants. Here are some giants who have come before me to make this technology possible. 

The Computa Pranksta relies on the following technologies, in rough order from what I consider "highest level" to lowest level.

1. [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/): the Pranksta uses the Arduino ecosystem, including the IDE. Arduino is _amazing._ I'm a professional software developer today, because of Arduino. Thank you Massimo Banzi, Arduino, and others!
1. [Digispark](http://digistump.com/products/1) - the device _hardware_ is based on the open source Digispark, by DigiStump. DigiStump is awesome. So glad they exist. [They were kickstarted](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/digistump/digispark-the-tiny-arduino-enabled-usb-dev-board), you know, in late 2012!
    1. [Here's the hardware schematic from Digispark](DigisparkSchematic.pdf)
    1. Online source:
        1. [DigiSpark pg](http://digistump.com/products/1) --> Resources --> "Schematics"
        1. [direct link](https://s3.amazonaws.com/digistump-resources/files/97a1bb28_DigisparkSchematic.pdf)
    1. Hardware license: [CC-BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)
    1. Note: it appears to me that diode D3 shown in the DigiSpark schematic is backwards, but I haven't confirmed with them to be sure.
1. Adafruit USB Keyboard and Mouse Library: ["TrinketHidCombo", with my changes](https://github.com/ElectricRCAircraftGuy/Adafruit-Trinket-USB/tree/master/TrinketHidCombo)
    1. License: LGPL 3 or later
1. [Micronucleus](https://github.com/micronucleus/micronucleus): this is the bootloader which allows me to upload my custom firmware which makes the Computa Pranksta a Computa Pranksta
    1. License for the bootloader only, not what has been uploaded by it: GPLv2
1. [V-USB](https://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/index.html): the software implementation of low-speed USB which allows the USB-incapable microcontroller which runs this device to bit-bang out the USB protocol. This is amazing. Micronucleus requires this. This is what makes Micronucleus able to communicate over USB, and it's what powers the underlying USB protocol to allow the Pranksta to become a USB HID keyboard and mouse combo.
1. [AVR Libc](https://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/): the C library implementation for the microcontroller in use; a key component to make it programmable.
1. [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/): the compiler which turns C and C++ code into machine code which can be run by the computer processor inside the Computa Pranksta. This is a beast. Perhaps *100 man years* of work have gone into its creation.

Also:

1. [Linux Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/): the free and open source, _and_ no cost (`free does NOT equal no-cost`!) operating system I now use for all of my development and programming of the devices before I mail them out to Amazon for fulfillment. I used to use Windows for all development, but have slowly gotten rid of Windows. Today, all the computers in my house run Linux Ubuntu, including the ones used by my 3 and 7 year old kids, and my wife's computer too. My wife flashes all firmware from a Linux computer using micronucleus at the command-line. Thank you wife, and Linux.
