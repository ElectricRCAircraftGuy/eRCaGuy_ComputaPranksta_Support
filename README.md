# eRCaGuy_ComputaPranksta_Support
Public support for my "Computa Pranksta" mouse jiggler device I sell on Amazon and elsewhere.

This device is a mouse jiggler. It keeps your computer awake. It can also be used to have some fun with your friends (please don't take it too far--it's meant to be used in good, friendly gest--not for any type of malicious purposes).

# Status:

It is functional and for sale!

Arduino (/ɑːrˈdwiːnoʊ/) is an open-source hardware and software company, project and user community that designs and manufactures single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller kits for building digital devices. Its hardware products are licensed under a CC-BY-SA license, while software is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) or the GNU General Public License (GPL),[1] permitting the manufacture of Arduino boards and software distribution by anyone. Arduino boards are available commercially from the official website or through authorized distributors.

Arduino board designs use a variety of microprocessors and controllers. The boards are equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards ('shields') or breadboards (for prototyping) and other circuits. The boards feature serial communications interfaces, including Universal Serial Bus (USB) on some models, which are also used for loading programs from personal computers. The microcontrollers can be programmed using the C and C++ programming languages, using a standard API which is also known as the "Arduino language". In addition to using traditional compiler toolchains, the Arduino project provides an integrated development environment (IDE) and a command line tool (arduino-cli) developed in Go.
