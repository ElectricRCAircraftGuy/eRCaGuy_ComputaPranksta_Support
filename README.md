# eRCaGuy_ComputaPranksta_Support
Public support for my "Computa Pranksta" mouse jiggler device I sell on Amazon and elsewhere.

This device is a mouse jiggler. It keeps your computer awake. It can also be used to have some fun with your friends (please don't take it too far--it's meant to be used in good, friendly gest--not for any type of malicious purposes).

# Status:

It is functional and for sale!
