You can have your high-schooler mass-3D-print these cases to sell them to raise money for college for all I care. Just link back to 1) [my product sales page on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2ReBSuN) and 2) to [this support page](https://github.com/ElectricRCAircraftGuy/eRCaGuy_ComputaPranksta_Support) is all I ask. If you ask me to link to your sales page for the cases you print and sell too I'll probably do that as well.

**On that note: I'm looking for a reliable person to ship my products for me so I don't have to deal with Amazon losing my inventory anymore. If you have a kid looking to make a little spending money, feel free to contact me. I'm trying to consider options other than Fulfilled-by-Amazon, because although as a _buyer_ I love them, as a _seller_ I can't stand them. They lose a large percent of what I ship to them, and their customer service to sellers is the worst in the world. They are horrible to work with.**

# Instructions:

Print it. Shove the Computa Pranksta into it. It's just a friction fit. No need to glue it at all; works great as-is! Done.  

Note: if you do want to glue it anyway, I recommend hot glue. It's inert, non-conductive, and safe for electronics.
